INE's web service is mostly undocumented and the function has
  been built by reverse engineering API calls. However, users may want to
  check the \emph{capabilities} of INEs WMS service at
  \url{http://goo.gl/aKn3vj}. Cadastre web service documentation can be
  consulted at \url{http://goo.gl/lKkwK} and WMS service \emph{capabilities}
